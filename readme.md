### How to use these scripts to learn on your own

- The scripts in this repo are for getting started with AWS PowerShell modules & commands.
  
- *While the AWS Cloud Shell is useful to get started, you will want to learn and use a tool to work with scripts.*

- The best way from within Visual Studio Code (VSCode), in a Linux, Mac or Windows workstation with PowerShell 7 installed. [See how to set that up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJNdK0QrIo8&t=2s)

- VSCode has a built in terminal, it is useful to have another terminal window open as well to run commands like `Get-Help`.

- You can clone this repo into VSCode to explore and enhance the scripts. [See how to do that.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVQCJ6sY8AQ)
  
- Review each script and run interesting commands one at a time with the `Run Selection` command, or `F8`.

- Extend these exporation scripts, and create your own exploration.

- Pick a small task you need to do in AWS and solve it with a PowerShell script. Then share it!
